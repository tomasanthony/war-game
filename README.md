# war-game
Implementation of the card game "War" for Intel's interview process.

## Developer Setup
This project uses python 3.9 and pipenv

Install requirements: ```pipenv install```

From the root project directory, to execute the game:
`python -m src.games.war`

To run the tests:
```pytest```



## If I Had More Time
If I had more time I would clean up the war.py file and break it into several discrete
functions.

I would have also written more tests.

The last thing I would have done would be to create a UI, as I intended, 
using TKinter to stay within the Python requirement of the assignment.
